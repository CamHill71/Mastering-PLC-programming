This is the code repository for [Mastering PLC Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/product/mastering-plc-programming/9781804612880), published by Packt.

**The software engineering survival guide to automation programming**

## What is this book about?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a new feature of PLC programming that has taken the automation world by storm. This book provides you with the necessary skills to succeed in the modern automation programming environment.
The book is designed in a way to take you through advanced topics such as OOP design, SOLID programming, the software development lifecycle (SDLC), library design, HMI development, general software engineering practices, and more.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Find out how to write PLC programs using advanced programming techniques
* Explore OOP concepts for PLC programming
* Delve into software engineering topics such as libraries and SOLID programming
* Explore HMIs, HMI controls, HMI layouts, and alarms
* Create an HMI project and attach it to a PLC in CODESYS
* Gain hands-on experience by building simulated PLC and HMI projects

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The commands will look like the following:
```
PROGRAM PLC_PRG
VAR
      dividend : INT;
      divisor: INT;
      division : INT;
END_VAR
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for automaton programmers with a background in software engineering topics such as object-oriented programming and general software engineering knowledge. Automation engineers, software engineers, electrical engineers, PLC technicians, hobbyists, and upper-level university students with an interest in automation or robotics will also find this book useful and interesting. Anyone with a basic knowledge of PLCs can benefit from reading this book.
